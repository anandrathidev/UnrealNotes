BaseTypes 
Enums 
UENUMS top of c++ enums metadata

Strings Fstring, Fname Unqie names for actors , Ftext - Localization
Collection: TMAp, Tarray cant have array of array, Tset
Transform types:  FVectors, Frotator Fquant Ftransform 
Actor Base  ones : UObject  , Actor <- Components can be attached to  Actors ()
                  Actors are memory managed by smart pointers. 
                  Actor &  Components can provide functionality 
                  Components = Mesh , Damagable , Spring Arm 
                  Life cycle of Actors : Levels , Spwend from Code/Blueprint . Managed by Smart pointers 
                  Creating :  Spawned by code , GC will destroy smart pointer.
                  


MACROS : UFUNCTION , UPROPERTY, UCLASS, GENERATEDBY , 
Inside macros there are specifiers : e.g BlueprintReadOnly , BlueprintReadWrite, BluwPrintCallable :UFUNCTION
